                        Health is defined as the complete physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual wellbeing of human beings..and not the mere absence of pain or infirmity in the body.
                        
                     </p>
           
                     <p>The main determinants of health are biological factors such as genetics and physio- regulatory dysfunctions; and socioeconomic factors such as poor housing, and low income; and environmental factors such as the quality of air  water and food...not to mention human behaviour or lifestyle factors. </p>

                     <p>Owing to globalization and human migrations across the 4 corners of the Earth, the exposure to knowledge about true meanings of developed and developing or underdeveloped world have become the reality of the day...and we can all understand that disparities between pre-industrial and industrialized economic systems where demographic and epidemiologic transitions are making big headlines.</p>

                     <p>
                        Low income economies or rather nations that are yet to realise the need to industrialize and manufacture products are bound to live in poverty and trail behind nations that are working so hard to overcome mediocrity and the shackles of poverty!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Poverty provides nothing but disaster to human happiness and the freedom to express the full human potential and display what one is truly made up of.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Poverty also bears a mentality that can be self- destructive, low self esteem, lacking the ability to create...and over-reliance on utopian realities...with excess wishful thinking!

                        <p>
                            In health, low income countries are regarded as places where most communicable and non- communicable diseases have their palatial habitations...this is due to lack of access to good healthcare systems and quality medicines by majority of the general populace...
                            These are countries where mental health issues have not yet been given much priority...development of good sanitation and hygiene systems are still in their infancy in the 21st century!
                            These are countries where instead of using available lands and disused buildings to build community health facilities and public places of convenience...they use every available piece of land to build a religious or worship centres because the emphasis is more on where they hope to go after dying more than how healthy they can live whilst they are still living! Because most people have misplaced priorities..and have less interest in understanding the true reality facing their very existence!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The current pandemic is said to be no respector of persons or nations...and the rich and poor individuals and nations are facing its impact equally...but thank God that the incidence and prevalence in other words the Epidemiology of this COVID-19 disease is less abundant within the developing economies..as we can all imagine the devastating impact it would have created for many of our relatives elsewhere. We know how these so-called economic SUPERPOWERS are even struggling to cope with COVID!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            COVID-19..has taught us all the need to place much priority on developing excellent health and healthcare systems by all nations...
                            These emerging pathogens also has taught us the need not sit and wait till something happens before we act...RESEARCH must be given every penny it needs by all governments...because it is only through research clinical and public health medicine will gain their strengths and evidential guidance they need to  save lives.

                            .... And POVERTY REDUCTION IF NOT ERADICATION...is the way to go and the future we should all anticipate and work very hard to support..because poverty  has nothing to offer but SUFFERING and PAIN..the classical symptoms of all diseases!
